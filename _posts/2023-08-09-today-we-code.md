Today we code

This is my coding anthem...

The day will come when the wisdom of men will fail
And bugs will crawl out from the screen [prevail]
But that day is not today!

The day will come when men would run from monoliths
And deadlines will hang their sweat-earned benefits
But that day is not today!

Today is the day we eat spaghetti code!
Today is the day we drink from the skulls of god classes
And unapologetically squash the bones of gray-haired bugs!
Today is the day we code!!!

For days will come when will watch long hours of YouTube
And spend all afternoon at the foosball table
But that day is not today

For the glory and for victory!
For success and for happiness!
To battle we match! For the love of code!!!
