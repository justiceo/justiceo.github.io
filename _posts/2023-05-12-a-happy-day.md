A Happy Day

A happy day
Begins the night before
With a shower at sunset
The tasks still undone,
Polished as todo-list for the morrow
Call the day before midnight
With a water bottle on the lamp post
Gym clothes laid out on the floor

A good morning
Is about the little wins
Getting off the bed on time
Sending up a prayer
Downing the bottle of water
Wetting the gym clothes
Taking an exhilarating shower
Giving the todo-list a quick glance

Winning the afternoon
Is about the checks on the little devils
Don't put off the tough tasks for later
Don't get stuck on them either
Put a timer on the social apps.
Decline meetings that should be emails
Keep your focus on that todo-list
Be critical of expanding it
