How to be an entrepreneur in an innovation-hostile environment

Success is not a quality problem, it is a cost problem - reduce the barrier to acquisition.

More precisely, the cost described here is Unit Acquisition Cost - the smallest amount a customer would need to pay out-of-pocket to derive the full value of the product. This is different and inversely related to the true cost of the product to the user. Essentially, it is costing the customer less now, but more in the long term.

Before investing significantly into a product targeted to SSA, ask yourself: Is there a cheaper albeit inconvenient way of doing this? In a country where 1 in 4 adults is unemployed, people have time, ample time for the most mundane tasks. What they lack is money. Don't expect them to spend it on convenience.

Nigerians don't buy iPhones because it is a better product than Samsung Galaxys, heck there are no Apple stores much less Apple Care, with less 1% penetration, there are no other iPhones to Airdrop with, or green receipts bars for messages. It's simply ostentatious. 

Innoson - one of the biggest entrepreneurs in Nigeria got his breakthrough in automobiles by making cheaper motorcycles, not by making better motorcycles. Cheaper Motorcycles meant lowered barriers to entry for millions of unemployed youths.

Another strategy to "reduce" cost without sacrificing quality, is reducing quantity. Omo detergent rose to prominence in the early 2000s, knocking out brands like Elephant, (see original packaging, and here) simply by packaging the detergent in smaller, more affordable sachets. And in a few years, sachet detergent became the next big battle ground! In reality, the smaller sachets would cost more, but then again, it reduces the barrier to acquisition.

When Klin entered the market, it challenged Omo by bundling bleaching+detergent for the same price. The result was a stronger whitening detergent. 

[detergent 1G, N10] + [bleach 1G, N10] = unit acquisition cost [N20]
[detergent 0.5G bleach 0.5G, N10] + [detergent 0.5G bleach 0.5G, N10] = unit acquisition cost [N10]

No product captures the importance of unit acquisition cost than Maggi, which sells bouillons as a big bag of small individually wrapped cubes - allowing retailers to sell the bouillons per cube! Making the unit acquisition cost N10 for 0.5kg, compare that to the US where the unit acquisition cost is NXX for a sachet of Knorr.


Lesson #1: If you're trying to enter an established market, you can't start by raising the unit acquisition cost.

#2 - You can't employ the boss/ You can't employ Founders.

My dad, now a retired civil servant, was a founder. His last stint was a small provision store which at its peak employed a sales girl, and every member of my family. 

For most Nigerians, the part to financial freedom isn't working for the government (which owes salaries in arrears) or a high paying private job (which fires at will) or some pension fund (that pays meagerly) or cashing out a stock. For many, it is solely owning and operating a profitable business.

Your employees will leave you the moment they have enough cash or skill to start their own business.

This is an important because many companies do not expect their employees to become their competitors, which is very much the case in the Nigeria environment. You say, what about non-compete clause I made them sign? I'll talk about it later.
