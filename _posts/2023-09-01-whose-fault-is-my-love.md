Whose fault is my love?

A diver with no parachute
Is me falling in love
What bliss is my plunge
How did I get here?

Can I unsee a splendor?
Does fate listen to man?
Is beauty not deserving admiration
Innocent I sure am

Can charming be uncharming?
Like beads, her virtues spread
Born beautiful, not made
Innocent she sure is

I blame love
Hearts are knit blindly
I blame chemistry
Keys are dignified in locks

I blame desire
Fulfilment accursed we seek
I blame fate
For t'is right this time
