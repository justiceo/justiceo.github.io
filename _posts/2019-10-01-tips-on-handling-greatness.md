 Most of everyday living is cliche, a routine, and rarely I meet "different". This is about the blue-moon occassions when I meet something that isn't just different, but great! I don't encounter great people, ideas or products often, such encounters are opportunistic, and I gotta be ready to capitalize!

## Iterate on Ideas
When you have a eurake moment, a revolutionary idea, think on it, don't go buy the domain, do not go pitching it to investors, don't start designing your life around it. *certainly no material investments*. Instead, sleep on it - write it down - iterate on it and its prototype... till you have a great product. Never invest in your idea, or someone else's idea, etc. Even at work, ideas barely make it through prototype - focus on iteration. Share ideas liberally, that way, you can iterate faster from the feedback of others. Validate ideas with data and experiments where necessary. talk is cheap. money is the wrong-motivator for a project in the idea phase.

## Partner with Skills
When you run into highly skilled individuals, do not pay them to work for you or simply fund their labor - they may not even know what to do with such investment. They have no obligation to return a profit to you either. Partner with skilled individuals in mutually beneficial ways. No party is "paying" the other to stay in the partnership and any party should be able to leave the partnership at any time. This brings out the best of the skills and ensure its relevance to the partnership - otherwise it would leave or be substituted. When you pay skill, you silence it, and for an entrepreneur, this is valuable feedback you're losing. 

## Sell(Pitch) products
Product is an indication of tangible investment on your end... it says I'm not a talker, I'm a doer. The product sells itself in the hands of the investor. Everyone has the idea of a great smartphone, Apple puts that idea in people's hands. There is clarity on where funds will take the product. There is demonstrable knowledge and process to creating the product. Feedback on a product is concrete not abstract as is the case for ideas. Importantly, do not invest in the product (beyond the scope of pitching it). If you can't pitch/sell it, it may not be worth your investment.

## Invest in people 
Probably the most important rule of these. Great ideas are only yours before it hits the market, partners can always substitute you, good products  are replaced by better products, but great (focused, honest, hardworking,...) individuals are the backbone behind all the above. This specie of humans are rare to find and only a few companies understand why investing in people is crucial as Google understands it. Investing in people basically brings out the best in them which could mean an extra iteration on the idea, learning loathed skills critical for the business, pitching the product like their future depended on it and caring about the investors (users). This is also the most fulfilling kind of investment. People can appreciate when you invest in them, products cannot and neither can ideas. A lot of VCs advocate investing in teams because people drive the idea - execution is not a commodity. Ideas are commodity, execution is key.

## Relate with Investors 
Investors as wealthy individuals who are short on ways to invest their stash of cash. Your goal is to convince them that your business/product would give them a better return. Basically, you're asking them to take their eggs out of an already profitable basket, and put it in your basket. Listen to investors - figure out what their goals are, what are they trying to achieve with their wealth? This ensures you're getting a suited investor - one that actually cares about your product not just the money. By talking to them without pitching - you get valuable advice on how to grow your business without an outright "no I'm not interested". And lastly, good investors know better investors, they would be first to link you up when the opportunity is right. Their success is built on a lot of failures, seek to learn from it.
