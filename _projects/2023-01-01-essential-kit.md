## The browser is the new desktop OS

We spend the majority of our time on a laptop/desktop using a browser and some estimates put it at [56%](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics) and growing.

The [rising popularity of chromebooks](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/30/theres-no-stopping-chromebooks-from-dominating-the-world/) emphasizes our burgeoning dependence on the browser and the gradual shift of applications from native to web deployments.

As browsers grow in usage, so do the extensions that make them delightful; from [adblockers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/adblocker) to [custom cursors](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/custom%20cursor). While much has been done to save netizens from malicious or data-grabbing websites, but not as much effort has been dedicated in the browser extensions front.

## Browser extensions are the new attack vector

It feels like every other week, I see a headline like "[Chrome extensions with 1.4M installs covertly track visits and inject code](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/google-removes-extensions-that-covertly-tracked-users-and-injected-javascript/)". People have gotten smart about not installing .exe files from random websites, same cannot be said of browser extensions; the prevailing theory is that if it has over 100K users and 5 star rating, it must be good.

This personally affected me in 2018 when an extension I loved got blocklisted because it was sniffing user data and reselling it to marketers. Out of frustration, I created [an alternative](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/write-better/nnnnnpmcdcloafmfkiihafnjidjkfmek?hl=en) to that extension that was [open-source](https://github.com/justiceo/write-better) and collected 0 data, in fact, there was no server at all. From there, the idea of Essential Kit was born: a collection of safe, secure, high-quality alternatives to critical browser extensions.

## Making essential extensions safe, secure and high-quality
Essential kit is a passion project of mine. Occassionally, I evaluate the list of popular extensions that I use to determine if any of them is a candidate for Essential kit. 

I prefer extensions that 
* can work solely offline - as they remove the risk of data exfilteration.
* are open-source - so I can inpsect the code if I get sceptical.
* have high usage - as such are often the target of security and privacy attacks.

In the process, I have developed processes that make it easy for me to create, publish and maintain the essential kit extensions with little bandwidth (mostly through automation).
