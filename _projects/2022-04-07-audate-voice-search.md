This voice search extension is part of my effort to bring voice forward experiences to the browser.

When compared to typing, voice is:

* 🏃‍♀️ Faster: Like 3X faster than typing.
* 🍹 Easier: You can dictate notes while pacing, eating, driving.
* 👶 Natural: Voice queries are more expressive, leading to more featured snippets in search results.
* ♿ Accessible: Everyone can speak, 2yr olds, tired grannies, illitrates, name it.

My goal is to make it voice interaction as ubiquitous as typing... on the web. There are two parts to it

👥 Helping end-users discover and use voice input.
🏢 Working with publishers to make their content more accessible through voice.
